<p class="text-center">We are the Mathematics Undergraduate Student Association of the University of California, Berkeley!</p>
<div class="resource">
<p>We strive to improve the overall quality of studying mathematics here as an undergraduate, especially by
advocating for issues that benefit the entire undergraduate math community, not only the subset that attends our
events.</p>
<p>Joining MUSA is an excellent way to connect with other math enthusiasts. You can learn about the many
opportunities for math students, including little tricks that will help you survive the rigorous math curriculum
here.</p>
<p><strong>Our office</a>,
938 Evans</strong>, is usually open, selling hoodies and food &mdash; but we encourage students to come in just
to chat about math or life. We won't bite!</p>
<p>We encourage students to come to our <strong>Thursday events, held in 1015 Evans</strong>, where
you can meet fellow math geeks and get valuable information. Our events are open to the public,
<strong>not just declared math majors</strong> &mdash;
so don't be a stranger!</p>
<p>Most annoucements are done over MUSA's mailing list.</p>

<h3>Math Monday</h3>
<p>The Math Monday undergraduate lecture series is the flagship event of MUSA. It is a series of talks, every Monday at 5 PM, given by professors and other academics about mathematical research and special topics. (<a href="monday.html">Archive</a>)</p>
<h4>Intro to Erotic Theory</h4>
<p>James Leng</p>
<p>16 January &mdash; 1015 Evans</p>
<p>We discuss ergo-dick.</p>

<h3>Featured Problem</h3>
<p>At MUSA, we love to talk about tricky math problems of all levels! Here's some of our favorite problems. If you can't figure them out yourself, try asking at office hours and see if anyone else can make heads or tails of them. (<a href="problems.html">Archive</a>)
<h4>Topological invariants and the open mapping theorem</h4>
<p><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Math 185; Math 142 or Math 202A will help</p>
<p>Say that a metric space X is locally connected if for each point x of X there is a connected open set U containing x. Let K be a locally connected compact subset of the complex plane and V(K) denote the vector space of all holomorphic functions V(K) â†’ C. Give a formula for the dimension of V(K) in terms of topological invariants of K.</p>
<p>If that was pretty easy, what happens if K is not locally connected? In particular, what is the dimension of V(K), for K the Cantor set?</p>
